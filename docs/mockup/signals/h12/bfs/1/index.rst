Burkina Faso *An. gambiae* H12 #1
=================================

This page describes a signal of selection found in the :ref:`mockup_bfs`
population using the :ref:`mockup_h12` statistic.

The inferred focus of this signal is on chromosome arm 2L from position
2,420,000 to 2,460,000. The following 3 genes overlap the focal region:
:ref:`AGAP001234`, :ref:`AGAP001234`, :ref:`AGAP001234`. The following 5 genes
are in windows immediately adjacent to the focal region: :ref:`AGAP001234`,
:ref:`AGAP001234`, :ref:`AGAP001234`, :ref:`AGAP001234`, :ref:`AGAP001234`.
