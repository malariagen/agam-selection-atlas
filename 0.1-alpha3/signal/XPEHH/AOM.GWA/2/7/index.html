<p>This page describes a signal of selection found in the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../../../population/AOM.html"><span class="doc">Angola An. coluzzii</span></a> population
when compared with the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../../../population/GWA.html"><span class="doc">Guinea Bissau</span></a> population
using the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../../../method/XPEHH.html"><span class="doc">XPEHH (Cite et al. 20XX)</span></a> statistic.The focus of this signal is on chromosome arm
<strong>2R</strong> between positions <strong>28,480,000</strong> and
<strong>28,520,000</strong>.
The evidence supporting this signal is
<strong>weak</strong> (<img class="math" src="../../../../../_images/math/def0b4bd6a0167dd23e206225cdf84431b44549d.png" alt="\Delta_{i}"/> &lt; 50 on one or both flanks).</p>
<p>This signal overlaps the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../../../known-locus/cyp6p.html"><span class="doc">Cyp6p locus</span></a>, a genome
region with prior evidence of an association with insecticide resistance and/or recent positive selection in
<em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes.</p>
