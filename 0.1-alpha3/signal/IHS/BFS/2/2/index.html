<p>This page describes a signal of selection found in the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../../../population/BFS.html"><span class="doc">Burkina Faso An. gambiae</span></a> populationusing the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../../../method/IHS.html"><span class="doc">IHS (Cite et al. 20XX)</span></a> statistic.The focus of this signal is on chromosome arm
<strong>2R</strong> between positions <strong>3,380,000</strong> and
<strong>3,900,000</strong>.
The evidence supporting this signal is
<strong>strong</strong> (<img class="math" src="../../../../../_images/math/def0b4bd6a0167dd23e206225cdf84431b44549d.png" alt="\Delta_{i}"/> &gt;= 100 on both flanks).</p>
<p>This signal overlaps the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../../../known-locus/ace1.html"><span class="doc">Ace1 locus</span></a>, a genome
region with prior evidence of an association with insecticide resistance and/or recent positive selection in
<em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes.</p>
