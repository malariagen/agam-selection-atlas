# Ag1000G selection atlas

This repository contains code for building the [Ag1000G selection
atlas](https://malariagen.github.io/agam-selection-atlas/).

## Information for developers

Here's how to set up a local development environment to build the
site.

### Cloning the repo

The site is deployed via GitHub pages. To get your local system set up
in a way that is compatible with the live deployment of the site
requires cloning the repo in a particular way.

Clone the GitHub repo for source code development:

```
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:malariagen/agam-selection-atlas.git
```

Make a directory representing the "malariagen.github.io" site:

```
$ mkdir malariagen.github.io
$ cd malariagen.github.io
```

Clone the GitHub repo again for deployment of the built site (via the
gh-pages branch):

```
$ git clone git@github.com:malariagen/agam-selection-atlas.git
$ cd agam-selection-atlas
$ git checkout gh-pages
```

Local directory structure should now look something like:

```
$ cd ../..
$ tree -L 2
.
├── agam-selection-atlas
│   ├── agam-report-base
│   ├── annotation
│   ├── build
│   ├── deps
│   ├── docs
│   ├── env.sh
│   ├── LICENSE
│   ├── notebooks
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── scripts
│   ├── snakemake
│   └── templates
└── malariagen.github.io
    └── agam-selection-atlas
```

So the repo has been cloned twice, into two different locations, one
of which will be used for site development, the other for site
deployment (checked out to gh-pages branch).


### Setting up external data resources

To perform the selection scans and build the signals, some external
data resources from Ag1000G and vectorbase are needed in the
agam-selection-atlas development directory. There is a utility script
that will download these to your local system via FTP:

```
$ cd agam-selection-atlas
$ ./download-external-data.sh
```

This will download files to a "data" folder in the repo root
directory. If you want to store these elsewhere, create a symlink.


### Setting up the execution environment

To set up a local execution environment, do:

```
$ ./binder/install-conda.sh
```

To activate the environment, do:

```
$ source binder/env.sh
```


### Building the signals

Building of the selection signals data is controlled via the
``snakemake/data.yml`` rules file. Building the signals data can take
a bit of time, so only rebuild if necessary.  E.g., to build all H12
signals:

```
$ snakemake -s snakemake/data.yml all_h12
```

### Building the site

Building of the static web site is controlled via the
``snakemake/site.yml`` rules file.  To completely rebuild the site,
do:

```
$ snakemake -s snakemake/site.yml all
```

First time round this will take some time, as many pages (especially
for genes) need to be built, although any subsequent incremental
builds will be faster, especially if they don't require rebuilding the
gene pages.


### Previewing the site

The final step in the site build copies all built files across to the
``malariagen.gitub.io/agam-selection-atlas`` folder where the gh-pages
branch is checked out. To preview the site, do:

```
$ cd ../malariagen.github.io
$ python -m http.server
```

...then browse to [http://0.0.0.0:8000/agam-selection-atlas/dev/](http://0.0.0.0:8000/agam-selection-atlas/dev/).

Note that some changes make need an empty cache and hard reload in the
browser.
