TODO
====

* [x] Add known locus pages.
* [x] Add signals to known locus pages.
* [x] Add genes to known locus pages.
* [x] Add section for known loci to signal pages.
* [x] Add column for known loci to signals tables everywhere.
* [x] Add section for known loci to gene pages.
* [x] Add more known locus pages (Cyp9k1, Tep1, ...)
* [x] Add evidence for known locus pages.


* [ ] Change percentile to be computed as percentile over all raw values not windowed values.

* [ ] Try polarising IHS by major allele

* [ ] Scatter plots of max percentile versus peak model fit for all signals page, population pages, seqid pages, statistic pages

* [ ] Pages and plots to browse the windowed statistics over the genome

* [x] Check gene pages, e.g., Vgsc, why no signals?
* [x] Fix asterisc in hover label for population comparison
* [x] Review XPEHH results, can we remove any of the comparisons?
* [x] Investigate IHS, any way to tighten up the signals?
* [x] Build XPEHH signals for Guinea-Bissau
